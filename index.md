# Jack Weston's First CS193 Homework

Some of my favorite things about CS193 thus far include;
- It seems like a basic, staight-forward class.
- I'll probably learn important information and tricks about the Computer Science Major.
- The teachers seem alright.
- Github

That concludes my list and first website.
